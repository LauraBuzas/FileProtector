Data security is an important matter when it comes to privacy. As mentioned before, integrity is a matter that is not addressed with a maximum level of protection on Windows and neither on Linux. For this little flaw I've come with a solution available only for Windows that adds functionality to the existent mechanisms.

The designed solution provides users with file protection, with guarantee that only they can access their protected files. The most important part of the application is the minifilter driver, where the logic for file blocking has been done. However, the user communicates with the minifilter through a UI having as main functionality the management of the protected files along with other features.

Lastly, the application can be improved regarding performance by implementing various algorithms for file name matching and also it can be extended to fit smoothly in a large scale enterprise environment.
